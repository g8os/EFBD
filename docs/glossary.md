# Glossary

## [ A - J ]

### AGGMQ

The [Aggregation](#aggregation) Message Queue (AGGMQ) is used to queue [aggregations](#aggregation) in the [TLog](#tlog) server as they are waiting to be processed. See the [TLog docs][tlog] for more info.

### aggregation

An aggregation consists out of a group of [TLog](#tlog) sequences and some metadata (such as the [vdisk](#vdisk)'s identifier). See the [TLog docs][tlog] for more info. The aggregation definition can be found as a [Cap'n Proto][capnp] schema [tlog_schema.capnp][tlogschema].

### ARDB

ARDB (or "A Redis Database") is the collective term used for the underlying storage where the [persistent](#persistent) [vdisks](#vdisk)' [data (1)](#data) and [metadata (1,2,3)](#metadata) are stored. In production [redis][redis] is used, while [LedisDB][ledis] is used for test- and dev purposes. See the [NBD storage docs][storage] for more info. Usually a group of servers (called a cluster) are used together, in order to spread the data and processing.

### backend

[NBD](#nbd) backend is the core implementation of all [volume drivers](#volume-driver) used via the [NBD server](#nbd). It is used as glue between the [gonbdserver](/nbd/gonbdserver) and the actual underlying [NBD storage (2)](#storage). See the [NBD docs][nbd] for more info.

### backup

Using the [zeroctl](#zeroctl) tool, one can make a backup of a [vdisk](#vdisk) using the [export command][cmdexport]. The backup can then be restored again using the [import command][cmdimport], either as a new [vdisk](#vdisk), or overwriting an existing [vdisk](#vdisk).

### block

All [vdisks](#vdisk)' [data (1)](#data) is stored as blocks, with a dynamic size usually measured in bytes. 4096 KiB is the standard size for [boot](#boot) [vdisks](#vdisk). See the [NBD storage docs][storage] for more info.

### boot

Boot is one of the available [vdisk](#vdisk) types. It uses the [deduped storage](#deduped) as its underlying [storage (2)](#storage) type. [Data (1)](#data) and [metadata (1,3)](#metadata) are redundant by making use of the [TLog](#tlog) client. The boot type is meant for (OS) images, hence the name. See the [NBD docs][nbd] for more info.

### cache

1. Cache is one of the available [vdisk](#vdisk) types. It uses the [nondeduped storage](#nondeduped) as its underlying [storage (2)](#storage) type. As its name suggests it is meant for caching. See the [NBD docs][nbd] for a more elaborabe overview.

2. A Least Recently Used (LRU) cache is used to cache loaded [LBA sectors](#sector). The cache only keeps a low amount of [sectors](#sector) in memory, and evicts the [sector](#sector) last used in case the cache is full.

### data

1. Data in the context of [vdisks](#vdisk) refers usually to the actual [blocks](#block), which are [stored](#storage) on an [ARDB](#ardb) cluster. See the [NBD docs][nbd] for more info.

2. [TLog Transactions](#tlog) are sometimes also refered to as data, especially in the context of the [TLog server][tlogserver].

### db

Database (db) is one of the available [vdisk](#vdisk) types. It uses the [nondeduped storage](#nondeduped) as its underlying [storage (2)](#storage) type. [Data (1)](#data) and [metadata (3)](#metadata) are redundant by making use of the [TLog](#tlog) client. The boot type is meant for (OS) images, hence the name. See the [NBD docs][nbd] for more info.

### deduped

[Blocks](#block) stored in the deduped [storage (2)](#storage) are only stored once, and are identified by their block [hash](#hash), which is referenced via its [metadata (1)](#metadata). See the [deduped storage docs][dedup] for more info.

### hash

A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. In the case of 0-Disk it can be assumed that the [blake2b][blake2b] cryptographic hashing algorithm is used, unless explicitly specified otherwise. A hash is the name for the fixed-sized data produced by the hashing algorithm.

### hotreload

Any 0-Disk config supports hot reloading as an optional feature, for where it is needed. Meaning that the config can be reloaded without having to restart the application using it. See the [config docs][config] for more info.

### index

1. Sequence index is used to identify a [TLog](#tlog) sequence in order. The index is automatically asigned by the [TLog Server][tlogserver].

2. [Block](#block) index is used to identify a [vdisk](#vdisk)'s [block](#block). The index can be calculated using the formula `i = position % blockSize`, where both the position and blockSize are expressed in bytes. 

3. [LBA](#lba) [sector](#sector) index is used to identify an [LBA](#lba) index. The index can be calculated using the formula `i = blockIndex % 128`.

## [ K - T ]

### LBA

Logic Block Addressing (LBA) is the scheme used for specifying the location of [deduped](#deduped) [blocks](#block), by mapping each existing [block](#block) [index (2)](#index) to the [hash](#hash) of that [block](#block). This scheme is [stored (1)](#storage) as [metadata (3)](#metadata). See the [deduped storage docs][dedup] for more info.

### log

1. Debug, Info and Error logs are supported and is done using the [0-Disk/log](/log) module. By default these are logged to the _STDERR_, but both the [NBD server](#nbd) and the [TLog server](#tlog) support logging to a file, if given a path to write to.

2. 0-Disk components are just a small piece of the Zero-OS ecosystem. In case a 0-Disk component (such as [NBD server](#nbd) or [TLog server](#tlog)) has to communicate to other components (such as [0-Orchestrator][0-Orchestrator]), it does so using the [zerolog][0-Log] package, which provides formatted _STDERR_ logging, for exactly this purpose of providing a communication medium between Zero-OS components.

3. [Transactions are logged](#tlog) are logged for [vdisks](#vdisk) which support it and is enabled. This is an option for both [db](#db) and [boot](#boot) [vdisks](#vdisk).

### metadata

1. A [Deduped](#deduped) [vdisk](#vdisk) [stores (2)](#storage) the [LBA](#lba) scheme as metadata.

2. [SemiDeduped](#semideduped) [vdisk](#vdisk) [stores (2)](#storage) a bitmap, which indicates what underlying [storage (2)](#storage) is used to store a [block](#block), as metadata.

3. If a supported [vdisk](#vdisk) is [TLog](#tlog)-enabled, it stores some (extra) metadata. See the [TLog storage docs][tlogstorage] for more info.

4. The [TLog server](#tlog) stores its (critical) metadata per [vdisk](#vdisk) in the [0-stor storage (3)](#storage). See the [TLog docs][tlog] for more info.

### NBD

Network Block Device is the name for the Linux-originated protocol as described in [this specification document][nbdproto]. It allows us to mount [vdisks](#vdisk) as if they were a physical block device. When a client connects to the nbdserver it is being handled by the [gonbdserver](/gonbdserver), which on its turn delegates the actual storage work onto the [nbd backend](#backend).

### nondeduped

[Blocks](#block) stored in the nondeduped [storage (2)](#storage) are stored, identified directly using their [block index (2)](#index). Because of this no [metadata](#metadata) is required for the storage of nondeduped [blocks](#block). See the [nondeduped storage docs][nondedup] for more info.

### persistent

[VDisk](#vdisk) [data (1)](#data) and [metadata (1,2,3)](#metadata) are made persistent by storing it in one or multiple [ardb clusters](#ardb). This is the case for all [vdisk](#vdisk) types.

### player

The [TLog](#tlog) player can read the [logged (3) transactions](#log) and use it to [restore](#restore) a [vdisk](#vdisk) by writing it directly to the [NBD backend](#backend). This player is used by the [zeroctl](#zeroctl) restore command for example. See the [TLog Player docs][tlogplayer] for more info.

### pool

In order to limit the amount of connections to a single [storage (1)](#storage) server, a pool is used. Meaning that for example only 10 connections at the same time can be established. Note that that this pool is only limiting at a local level. Each mounted [vdisk](#vdisk) for example has its own pool _per_ [storage (1)](#storage) server, therefore if that vdisk uses 5 [storage (1)](#storage) servers, it will also use 5 pools. Another mounted [vdisk](#vdisk) will never share pools of another [vdisk](#vdisk), even if they use the same servers. The [NBD](#nbd) and [TLog](#tlog) modules have each their own pool implementation.

### redundant

Both the [boot](#boot)- and [db](#db) [vdisk](#vdisk) types have support to make the [data (1)](#data) and [metadata (1,2,3)](#metadata) redundant:

+ [TLog](#tlog) rpc addresses can be given in the [vdisk](#vdisk)'s [TLog config][tlogconfig];
+ When [TLog](tlog) support is enabled, a [slave](#slave) [storage (1)](#storage) cluster also be specified in the [vdisk](#vdisk)'s [TLog config][tlogconfig];
+ A [vdisk](#vdisk) can also make a [backup](#backup) of itself;

### replay

All [logged (3)](#log) ([TLog](#tlog)) transactions can be played back in sequence using the [TLog Player](#player) up to any given time or sequence in tracked history, usually done so using the [zeroctl](#zeroctl) tool.

### restore

[Redundant](#redundant) content can be restored using the [TLog Player](#player) to any given time or sequence in tracked history, usually done so using the [zeroctl](#zeroctl) tool.

### rollback

[Redundant](#redundant) content can be rolled back to any given time or sequence in tracked history, usually done so using the [zeroctl](#zeroctl) tool. See the [tlog docs][tlog] for more info.

### semideduped

Semi Deduped storage is a hybrid storage, using read-only [deduped storage](#deduped) to store the [template](#template) content, and [nondeduped storage](#nondeduped) to store any content (modifications) written by the user. See the [semideduped storage docs][semidedup] for more info.

### sector

An [LBA](#lba) sector contains 128 hashes, and is kept in an LRU [cache (2)](#cache) when it is loaded because one of those hashes were required, so the sector is available for more reads if needed. See the [deduped docs][dedup] for more info.

### slave

A slave [storage (1)](#storage) cluster is a mirror of a vdisk's primary [storage (1)](#storage) cluster by the [TLog server][tlogserver]. Such that in case of failure the primary [storage (1)](#storage) cluster can be restored using the slave [storage (1)](#storage) cluster.

### storage

1. An [ARDB cluster](#ardb) is used as the [persistent](#persistent) storage for all [vdisks](#vdisk) mounted using the [NBD server](#nbd). Only the primary storage cluster (usually shortened to 'storage cluster') is required. The [TLog](#tlog) cluster is required in case you want to make use of it for those [vdisks](#vdisk) that support it. In such case you can also optionally make use of the [Slave](#slave) cluster. Optionally you can also make use of a [Template](#template) cluster for those [vdisks](vdisk) that support it.

2. [NBD backend](#backend) storage types define how a [persistent](#persistent) [vdisk](#vdisk)'s [data (1)](#data) and [metadata (1,2,3)](#metadata) is stored in an [ARDB cluster](#ardb).

3. [0-stor][0-stor] is used to store [TLog](#tlog) [data (2)](#data) and [metadata (4)](#metadata), using the [0-stor-lib][0-stor-lib].

### template

A [boot](#boot) [vdisk](#vdisk) can make use of a template [storage (1)](#storage) cluster. From this cluster [blocks](#block) can be copied on-the-fly into the primary [storage (1)](#storage) cluster in case the latter doesn't have the required [block](#block) available. Note that this only works for a [boot](#boot) vdisk if it was created as a ([metadata (1)](#metadata)) copy from the [vdisk](#vdisk) on that template [storage (1)](#storage) cluster using the the [zeroctl](#zeroctl) tool's [copy command][cmdcopy].

A [db](#db) [vdisk](#vdisk) can also make use of a template [storage (1)](#storage) cluster. However, it does not have any [metadata](#metadata) and thus does not required being copied first. Instead you simply declare a non-existent [db](#db) [vdisk](#vdisk) (with template [storage (1)](#storage) cluster defined) in the [config][config], and the [blocks](#block) will be copied into the primary [storage](#storage) cluster on-the-fly, the first time they are being read.

### TLog

The Transaction [Log (3)](#log) (TLog) module provides a [server][tlogserver], [client][tlogclient] and player. Its purpose is to make [vdisk](#vdisk)'s [data (1)](#data) and [metadata (1,2,3)](#metadata) [redundant](#redundant) by storing all write transactions applied by the user in a seperate [storage (3)](#storage) in a secure and efficient manner.

Both the [boot](#boot)- and [db](#db) [vdisk](#vdisk) types have TLog support. [VDisks](#vdisk) of this type can enable it by defining a TLog [storage (1)](#storage) cluster in its configuration.

### tmp

tmp (short for Temporary) is one of the available [vdisk](#vdisk) types. It uses the [nondeduped storage](#nondeduped) as its underlying [storage (2)](#storage) type. Its [data (1)](#data) is persistent as long as it mounted via the [NBD server](#nbd). The [vdisk](#vdisk) is deleted as soon as it is unmounted. See the [NBD docs][nbd] for a more info..

## [ U - Z ]

### vdisk

A Virtual Disk (vdisk) is the 0-Disk component which emulates an actual [block](#block) [storage (2)](#storage) device. The actual [data (1)](#data) and [metadata (1,2,3)](#metadata) of the vdisk is stored in an [ardb cluster](#ardb). Using the [NBD server](#nbd) it can be mounted and used as if it was a physical disk.

### volume driver

A volume driver defines the actual properties of a [vdisk](#vdisk). A driver is identified by a type. Examples of [vdisk](#vdisk) types are: [boot](#boot), [cache (1)](#cache) and [db](#db).

### zeroctl

The 0-Disk command line tool, used to manage [vdisks](#vdisk). See the [zeroctl docs][zeroctl] for more info.
